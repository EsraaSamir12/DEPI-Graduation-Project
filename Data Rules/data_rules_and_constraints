Score–Result relationship:
If Score < 8 → Result = 'Fail'
If Score ≥ 8 → Result = 'Pass'
Validity rules (IsValid):
If Result = 'Fail' → IsValid = 'Invalid'
If Result = 'Pass':
If ExamDate is within the last 2 years from today → IsValid = 'Valid'
If ExamDate is older than 2 years → IsValid = 'Expired'

Date logic:
ExamDate must not be in the future.
All dates must be valid and formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.
Score value constraints:
Score must be an integer between 0 and 10.
No null or missing values allowed.
Applicant & Exam consistency:
Each (ApplicantID, ExamTypeID) pair is unique.
Applicants can have 1 or 2 exams .


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------Interviews---------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The applicant can only have an interview if:
Result = 'Pass'
IsValid = 'Valid'

The InterviewDate must be:
After the applicant’s ExamDate
Within a reasonable period (e.g., within 6 months of ExamDate) if required by the business rule
Applicants with:
Fail result →  Not eligible for interview
Expired exam →  Not eligible for interview

------------------------------------------------Application ----------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



If the applicant did not attend an interview but passed the exam,
→ their application status is Pending, meaning it is still under review and not yet decided.

If the applicant failed the exam and did not attend an interview,
→ their application status is Rejected, since failing the exam automatically disqualifies them from further stages.

If the applicant attended an interview and proceeded to the committee evaluation,
→ they will be Accepted if their final score is 5 or above,
→ otherwise, they will be Rejected.

------------------------------------------------Financial support ----------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All applicants in this table have officially requested financial support. The approval status depends on the requested amount relative to the maximum allowed amount — requests for small or moderate amounts (less than or equal to 80% of the maximum) are more likely to be approved, while requests exceeding 80% are more likely to be rejected to ensure fair and balanced fund distribution.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the date sequence is logical for each applicant : 
The ExamDate occurs after the ApplicationDate by a random period (at least one month).
The InterviewDate occurs after the ExamDate by a random period (at least two months).
